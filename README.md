# Hands-On Introduction to Google Earth Engine

This repository contains the companion guide for the hands-on activity in the context
of the "Hands-On Introduction to Earth Observation Applications"
workshop. Google Earth Engine is used for this activity, a cloud-based
web application for geospatial analysis that enables users to visualize
and analyze satellite images of our planet.
The first section of the guide illustrates setting up and how to get
started, no software or data downloads are required, every activity is
done using a web browser.
